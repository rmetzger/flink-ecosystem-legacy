# Proposal for Ecosystem Website API

## API's

---

### Error handling

On error, each endpoint returns a HTTP status code 500, and the following body
```javascript
data: {
  error: string // containing an error message to be displayed in the UI
}
```

### Authentication

An authenticated user is authenticated against GitHub.
An authenticated administrator is defined by a set of GitHub usernames in the configuration of the backend.

### Endpoints

#### Package

- **Schema**

  ```javascript
  <package> {
    id: string // a unique, immutable string identifiying this package. allowed: [a-z-_]{2,}
    name: string // human readable name
    description: string 
    readme: string // user can enter a markdown description
    image: blob // we should restrict the image size to 5kb
    website: string
    repository: string
    license: string
    commentsCount: number
    upvotes: number
    downvotes: number
    tags: string[] // tags are created automatically if they don't exist yet. Only [a-z-_]{2,} is allowed for tags.
    added: datetime
    updated: datetime
    owner: string // github username
  }

  ```

- **Get a package by id**

  GET `/api/v1/packages/:package`
  ```javascript
  data: {
    package: <package>
  }
  ```
  
  
- **Get packages a by search query**
  
  GET `/api/v1/packages?query=:queryString&page=:number&order=:order&direction=:dir`
  ```javascript
  data: {
    package: [<package>] // array of packages matching the queryString
    resultCount: <number> // total number of search query results
  }
  ```
  The `:queryString` supports a special syntax for selecting packages based on a tag: `tag:<string>`. No (or an empty query string) returns all packages.
  The `:order` parameter supports: `upvotes`, `comments`, `added`, `updated`.
  The `:dir` parameter supports: `asc`, `desc`.
  The call returns at most 30 packages per call. Additional packages need to be retrieved by going through the `page`s. `page`s are 1-indexed (1 is the 1st page, 2 is the 2nd page and so on)
    
- **Create a new package**
  POST `/api/v1/packages`
  ```
  data: <package>
  ```
Access to this endpoint is restricted to authenticated users.

- **Upvote a package**

POST `/api/v1/packages/:package/upvote`

Note: The system must keep an internal list of users who have up- or down-voted a package, to avoid duplicate voting.

Access to this endpoint is restricted to authenticated users.

- **Downvote a package**

POST `/api/v1/packages/:package/downvote`

Access to this endpoint is restricted to authenticated users.

On an update, the `updated` field is set to the current date.
